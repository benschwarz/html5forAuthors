<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Abstract</h2>

<p>This specification defines My Magic Specification to be even more awesome
than any other specification ever written.

<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Status</h2>

<p>This is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and may change under your, your
best friend's, your mother's, or your father's feet. This document changes
once in a lifetime, so don't trust it says what it said when you last read it,
because you don't know whose lifetime (or even other possibly useful
information, such as their age or species) that refers to.

<p>This specification is being produced by a dumb idiot, so don't bother
sending feedback.

<p>This specification is intended to replace absolutely nothing at all. It
should therefore avoid you from getting bored, becuase you will never have
nothing to do anymore, because this replaces it.

<h2 class="no-num no-toc">Table of Contents</h2>

<!--toc-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This specification is awesome. That's all you need as an introduction to it.
It's not worthy of mere words to describe it.

<h2>Amazing Magical Section</h2>

<p>This is the section of the document that says a <dfn>magical tool</dfn> is
one that possesses magic properties, and that a
<dfn title="non-magical tool">non-magical one</dfn> is one that possesses no
magical properties.

<p>If you wish to use a <span>magical tool</span>, it can be done with complete
ease, as, due to it's magic, it will help you use it. However, a
<span title="non-magical tool">boring plain old-fashioned one</span> can be a
lot harder to operate. This is true for things like <span>fish</span>.

<p>A <dfn>fish</dfn> is an animal. It's really boring. It's totally and utterly
normal. All it does is swim.

<h3>The First Subsection</h3>

<p>No other subsection will ever be as awesome as this, because this was here
first.

<h2 class="no-num">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I would like to kill Hixie for bullying me into writing this document, just
because he wanted to be able to give someone an example of how to use Anolis.
