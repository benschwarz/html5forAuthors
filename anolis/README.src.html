<!--toc-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The need for Anolis came from the need for long technical documents to
include niceties such as cross-references and a table of contents for the
purpose of easy navigation — doing this manually can be a great chore
especially when sections are numbered and a section is added, consequently
changing the numbering of many others, leading to it being advantageous to do
it programmatically.

<p>Anolis does this on HTML documents, as a number of sequential processes.
Currently cross-referencing, section numbering, table of contents creation, and
a number of substitutions are done (mainly relating to the current date).

<h2>Installing Anolis</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The following are the minimum requirements: later versions should also work
without issue.

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> 2.3
    <li><a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a> 2.0
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib">html5lib</a> 0.10
</ul>

<h3>Obtaining a copy</h3>

<p>Releases are occasionally made. A link to the latest release can be found
from the <a href="http://anolis.gsnedders.com">Anolis website</a>.

<p>Alternatively, a copy can be obtained from <dfn>our <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> repository</dfn>: this
is where our ongoing development occurs, and allows any revision (and therefore
any release) to be downloaded. Our repository is located at
<code><!--begin-link-->http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/<!--end-link--></code>.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Normally, installation is done through <a
href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>, with the
following command:

<p><code>python setup.py install</code>

<p>Please see setuptools' documentation for information on installation options
(such as installing in non-standard locations).

<h3>Running the test suite</h3>

<p>The source distribution and the current development copy (in <span
data-anolis-xref="our mercurial repository">Mercurial</span>) both contain a test suite.
It can be run with the following command:

<p><code>python runtests.py</code>

<p>Any test failures should be reported at our <dfn><a
href="http://bugs.gsnedders.com/projects/show/anolis">bug
tracker</a></dfn>.

<h2>Using Anolis</h2>

<p>Anolis is invoked through the <code>anolis</code> command. The
<dfn><code>--help</code></dfn> (or <dfn><code>-h</code></dfn>) option gives
some basic help.

<p>The <dfn><code>--enable</code></dfn> and <dfn><code>--disable</code></dfn>
options enable/disable respectively the process given as the option value
(e.g., <code>--disable=toc</code> disables building the <span
data-anolis-xref="table of contents/section numbering">table of contents and
numbering sections</span>). The default processes are <code>sub</code>
(<span>substitution</span>), <code>toc</code> (<span>table of contents/section
numbering</span>), and <code>xref</code> (<span>cross-referencing</span>). Any
enabled process loaded via <code>from processes import foo</code>, and if that
fails <code>import foo</code> (where <code>foo</code> is the process), and is
then called as <code>foo.foo(ElementTree, **kwargs)</code>.

<p>Some options alter what is used to parse and serialize the document: the
<dfn><kbd>--parser</kbd></dfn> option allows either <kbd>html5lib</kbd> (the
default) or <kbd>lxml.html</kbd> (this is quicker, but does not comply to the
<a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a> specification) to be used to parse
the input file, and the <dfn><kbd>--serialzier</kbd></dfn> option allows the
same two values, but controls the serializer used for output (note that
lxml.html has some rather severe issues as a serializer)<!--; passing the XXX:
need double hyphen <dfn><code>xml</code></dfn> option uses libxml2's XML parser
instead-->.

<p>The <dfn><kbd>--output-encoding</kbd></dfn> option sets the character
encoding used for output — this defaults to UTF-8. Treatment of characters that
cannot be represented in the set output encoding is dependant on the serializer
selected via the <span>--serialzier</span> option.

<p>Anolis offers a <dfn>compatibility mode</dfn>, which aims to be compatible
with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/postprocess">CSS3
module postprocessor</a> (within reason). This is mainly provided for the sake
of pre-existing <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> documents. The
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat</code></dfn> option turns on this compatibility mode,
although specific options that turn on just one compatibility feature at a time
are also available (and are documented below under each <span
data-anolis-xref="processes">process</span>) — these are all implied by the
<code>--w3c-compat</code> options, with one exception:
<code>--w3c-compat-crazy-substitutions</code>, as it can lead to undesirable
results.

<p>The options <dfn><code>--newline-char</code></dfn> and
<dfn><code>--indent-char</code></dfn> set the newline and indent strings (they
do not have to be a single character) respectively. They default to U+000A LINE
FEED (LF) and U+0020 SPACE respectively. These are only used when generating
large trees of generated markup, such as the table of contents.

<p>Other <span data-anolis-xref="processes">process</span> specific options are
documented under the <span data-anolis-xref="processes">process</span> to which
they belong.

<p>Upon a <dfn>fatal error</dfn>, processing of the document is terminated and
the output file is left unchanged.

<p>The <dfn>textContent</dfn> property is the same as that defined in <a
href="http://w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/">DOM Level 3 Core</a> on the Node
interface.

<p><dfn>Whitespace</dfn> is as defined in <a
href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>: <q>U+0020 SPACE, U+0009 CHARACTER
TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), and U+000D
CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)</q>.

<p><dfn>Interactive content</dfn> is as defined in <a
href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>: the <code>a</code>, <code>bb</code>,
<code>details</code>, and <code>datagrid</code> elements; the
<code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> elements when they have a
<code>controls</code> attribute; the <code>menu</code> element when the
<code>type</code> attribute is case-insensitively equal to
<code>toolbar</code>.

<p><dfn data-anolis-xref="id generation">When an <code>id</code> attribute is
needed, it is created as follows</dfn>:

<ol>
    <li>Let <var>i</var> be equal to 0.
    <li>If the element already has an <code>id</code> attribute, return its
value, and terminate this algorithm.
    <li>If the <code>title</code> attribute is present and its value is not
empty and does not consist of <span>whitespace</span> only, let
<var>generated_id</var> be equal to its value; otherwise, let
<var>generated_id</var> be equal to <span>textContent</span>.
    <li>The <var>generated_id</var> is stripped of leading/trailing
<span>whitespace</span> and converted to lowercase (behaviour of this is
dependent on the current locale setting of Python).
    <li>The first of the following list whose condition matches the current
state of the string is done:
        <ol>
            <li>If <var>generated_id</var> is an empty string,
<var>generated_id</var> is set to <code>generatedID</code>.
            <li>If the <dfn><code>--force-html4-id</code></dfn> option is used, or the DOCTYPE's public identifier is one of:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN</code>
                    <li><code>ISO/IEC 15445:2000//DTD HyperText Markup
                      Language//EN</code>
                    <li><code>ISO/IEC 15445:2000//DTD HTML//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN</code>

                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN</code>
                    <li><code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN</code>
                </ul>
              Then:
                <ol>
                    <li>All runs of characters apart from U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS
(-), U+002E FULL STOP (.), U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (0–9),
U+003A COLON (:), U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
Z (A–Z), U+005F LOW LINE (_), and U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN
SMALL LETTER Z (a–z) are replaced by a single U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-)
character within <var>generated_id</var>.
                    <li>Leading and trailing U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) characters
are removed from <var>generated_id</var>.
                    <li>If <var>generated_id</var> is not empty and if the
first character is not in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A 
LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z (A–Z) or U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN 
SMALL LETTER Z (a–z), <var>generated_id</var> is prefixed by a single U+0078 
LATIN SMALL LETTER X (x) character.
                </ol>
            
            <li>Otherwise, runs of characters that do not match the ifragment
production in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987">RFC 3987</a> are
replaced by a single U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) character within
<var>generated_id</var>, and then leading and trailing U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-)
characters are removed from <var>generated_id</var>.
        </ol>
    <li>If <var>generated_id</var> is empty, <var>generated_id</var> is set to <code>generatedID</code>.
    <li>Let <var>output_id</var> equal <var>generated_id</var>.
    <li>If <var>output_id</var> matches a ready-existing ID, continue to the
next step; otherwise, jump to step 12.
    <li>Increment <var>i</var> by one.
    <li>Let <var>output_id</var> equal <var>generated_id</var> suffixed with a 
U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) character followed by <var>i</var> as a big-endian base 
10 number.
    <li>Jump back to step 8.
    <li>The generated ID is <var>output_id</var>.
</ol>

<h2><dfn>Processes</dfn></h2>

<p>The elements listed in the below processes, except where otherwise stated,
are the local name of the element <!--either--> in null namespace<!-- or in the
<dfn>HTML namespace</dfn> (<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>)-->.

<h3><dfn>Cross-referencing</dfn></h3>

<p>Cross-referencing has three essential parts: <dfn
data-anolis-xref="definition">definitions</dfn> that define <dfn
data-anolis-xref="term">terms</dfn>, and <dfn
data-anolis-xref="instance">instances</dfn> of those <span
data-anolis-xref="term">terms</span>.

<p><span data-anolis-xref="term">Terms</span> are taken from the
<code>data-anolis-xref</code> attribute if present, failing that the
<code>title</code> attribute if that is present, otherwise from the
<span>textContent</span> property of the <code>dfn</code> element. By default,
Anolis will throw a <span>fatal error</span> if a <span>term</span> is defined
more than once: this behaviour can be turned off (causing the final
<span>definition</span> of the <span>term</span> to be the one that is used) by
the <dfn><code>--allow-duplicate-dfns</code></dfn> option.

<p><span data-anolis-xref="definition">Definitions</span> are marked-up with
the <code>dfn</code> element.

<p><span data-anolis-xref="instance">Instances</span> are marked-up with
various elements, depending on the setting of
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-xref-elements</code></dfn>: if it is disabled (the
default), the <code>abbr</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>i</code>,
<code>span</code>, and <code>var</code> elements are used for <span
data-anolis-xref="instance">instances</span>; if it is enabled, the
<code>abbr</code>, <code>acronym</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>bdo</code>,
<code>big</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>del</code>, <code>em</code>,
<code>i</code>, <code>ins</code>, <code>kbd</code>, <code>label</code>,
<code>legend</code>, <code>q</code>, <code>samp</code>, <code>small</code>,
<code>span</code>, <code>strong</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>sup</code>,
<code>tt</code>, <code>var</code> elements are used for <span
data-anolis-xref="instance">instances</span>. Those that are only there in
<span>compatibility mode</span> are there because either they should not
semantically be used for an <span>instance</span>, or because they are not
present in <a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>. An
<span>instance</span> is only used if it does not have an <span>interactive
content</span> or <code>dfn</code> element as either a parent or a child.

<p>Both <span data-anolis-xref="definition">definitions</span> and <span
data-anolis-xref="instance">instances</span> are <dfn
data-anolis-xref="cross-reference normalization">normalized</dfn> as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span> is stripped,
    <li>Converted to lowercase (behaviour of this is dependent on the current
locale setting of Python),
    <li>All consecutive <span>whitespace</span> is replaced with a single
U+0020 SPACE CHARACTER<!-- unless there is a <code>pre</code> element as a
parent-->, and
    <li>If <dfn><code>--w3c-compat-xref-normalization</code></dfn> is enabled,
all characters apart from U+0020 SPACE CHARACTER, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-),
U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (0–9), U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z (A–Z), and U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to
U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z (a–z) are removed.
</ul>

<p>If the <span>instance</span> is contained within a <code>span</code>
element, the <code>span</code> element is turned into an <code>a</code>
element, and a <code>href</code> attribute is added to link it to the
<span>definition</span> (e.g., <code>&lt;span>foo&lt;/span></code> becomes
<code>&lt;a href=#foo>foo&lt;/a></code>) — all other attributes are
preserved. Otherwise (when the <span>instance</span> is not contained within a
<code>span</code> element), the location of the <code>a</code> element when
linking an <span>instance</span> is dependent on the
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-xref-a-placement</code></dfn> option: if it is disabled
(the default), the <code>a</code> element is placed around the element
containing the <span>instance</span> (e.g., <code>&lt;i>foo&lt;/i></code>
becomes <code>&lt;a href=#foo>&lt;i>foo&lt;/i>&lt;/a></code>); if it is
enabled, the <code>a</code> element goes within the element containing the
<span>instance</span> and goes around all of its content (e.g.,
<code>&lt;i>foo&lt;/i></code> becomes <code>&lt;i>&lt;a
href=#foo>foo&lt;/a>&lt;/i></code>).

<h3><dfn>Table of contents/section numbering</dfn></h3>

<p>To create a table of contents, and to number the <span
data-anolis-xref="section">sections</span> of the document, an
<dfn>outline</dfn> is created (this is a list of <span
data-anolis-xref="section">sections</span>, which can each contain more <span
data-anolis-xref="section">sections</span>, where a <dfn>section</dfn>
represents a part of the document, and often has a <dfn
data-anolis-xref="section heading">heading</dfn> associated with it — for more
detailed definitions see <a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>). This
means not only are the <code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> elements supported, but
also elements such as <code data-anolis-xref="">section</code> are used to
create the <span>outline</span>. After creating the <span>outline</span>, every
<span>section</span> with a depth between those provided by
<dfn><code>--min-depth</code></dfn> and <dfn><code>--max-depth</code></dfn>
(defaulting to two and six respectively), and which has a <span
data-anolis-xref="section heading">heading</span>, is numbered if it does not
have <code>no-num</code> as a class, and is added to the table of contents if
it does not have <code>no-toc</code> as a class. <span
data-anolis-xref="section">Sections</span> without a <span
data-anolis-xref="section heading">heading</span> are treated as if they did
not exist, unless they have children, in which they will appear to exist while
not existing all at once (e.g., they increment the <span>section</span>
numbering, though that is not output anywhere; and they get a list item in the
table of contents, with only the children within it, and no link to the
<span>section</span> itself).

<p>The format of <span>section</span> numbers should comply with <a
href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6937">ISO
2145:1978</a>, Numbering of divisions and subdivisions in written documents.
This means that each <span>section</span> number is given by Arabic numerals,
seperated by a single U+002E FULL STOP character, and there is no trailing
U+002E FULL STOP character.

<p>The <span>section</span> number is inserted as the first child node of the
<span>section heading</span> as a <code>span</code> element with the
<code>class</code> attribute set to <code>secno</code>: this is copied into the
table of contents.

<p>Pre-existing <code>span</code> elements with a class of <code>secno</code>
are removed from all <span data-anolis-xref="section heading">section
headings</span>, regardless of whether their depth falls within the range given
by <code>--min-depth</code> and <code>--max-depth</code>.

<p>The table of contents is built up as an ordered list (an <code>ol</code>
element), with each <span>section</span> marked up as a <code>li</code>
element, and child <span data-anolis-xref="section">sections</span> are marked
up with an <code>ol</code> within that <code>li</code> (and this continues
recursively, ad infinitum). By default, the root element of the table of
contents (an <code>ol</code> element) is given a <code>class</code> attribute
set to <code>toc</code>; however, with the
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-class-toc</code></dfn> option this is placed on every
<code>ol</code> within the table of contents. The entire <span>section
heading</span> is copied to be the content of the list item, with all
<span>interactive content</span> elements and <code>id</code> attributes
removed.

<p>A <span>normal comment substitution</span> is done with
<var>sub_identifier</var> equal to <code>toc</code>, and the table of contents
as the replacement.

<h3><dfn>Substitution</dfn></h3>

<p>Various strings are replaced in magic ways: a <dfn>normal string
substitution</dfn> takes the form of <code>[xxx]</code> where xxx is
case-sensitively the replacement, which may be followed by any characters apart
from U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET (]) before the final U+005D RIGHT SQUARE
BRACKET character — these extra characters are effectively a comment, and
carry absolutely no meaning, and vanish into some as-of-yet unknown abyss when
the string replacement is done. The entire string must be contained within a
single text node.

<p>A <dfn>normal comment substitution</dfn> is one where there is a string,
<var>sub_identifier</var>, that identifies the comment for the substitution,
and the replacement. All nodes between a comment with a value equal to (with
leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span> removed) <code>begin-</code>
followed by <var>sub_identifier</var> and one with q value equal to (with
leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span> removed) <code>end-</code>
followed by <var>sub_identifier</var> are removed, and replaced with the
replacement. Additionally, any comment (with leading and trailing
<span>whitespace</span> removed) with a value equal to
<var>sub_identifier</var> is replaced with a comment with a value of
<code>begin-</code> followed by <var>sub_identifier</var>, the replacement, and
then a comment with a value of <code>end-</code> followed by
<var>sub_identifier</var>.

<p>The <dfn>W3C status</dfn> is found, when needed by one of the substitutions,
by iterating all text nodes in document order (i.e., attribute values and
comments have no effect), and for each node, the following is done (in this
order):

<ol>
    <li>If the node contains, case-insensitively, "latest", followed by one or
more <span>whitespace</span> characters, followed by "version", searching
stops, and the default is used (ED).
    <li>Otherwise, if the node, case-sensitively, contains
"http://www.w3.org/TR/" followed by one of "MO", "WD", "CR", "PR", "REC",
"PER", or "NOTE", which in turn is followed by U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-), then
searching stops, and the status is whatever matched the previous list of
options by the first match in the text node.
</ol>

<p>A side-effect of doing it in this order is the fact that if a node contains
both of these possible strings is that the latter is ignored, meaning that the
default (ED) is used.

<!-- I wish the above was more sane — it took me several hours to work out
(though the comment in the CSS3 Module Postprocessor docs saying, "If there is
a H2 subheading under the H1 that gives the spec's status, the [STATUS]
variable will be initialized from that, otherwise it will default to WD." did
not help me work it out quickly, as what is done is completely utterly
different to that) — even though the algorithm is simple enough, it is just
far too unexpected. Sadly, though, pre-existing documents depend on this very
exact behaviour, and thus it cannot be changed. -->

<p>There is also a <dfn>long W3C status</dfn>, which correlates to the
<span>W3C status</span> under the following mapping:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><span>W3C Status</span>
        <th><span>Long W3C Status</span>
    <tr>
        <td>MO
        <td>W3C Member-only Draft
    <tr>
        <td>ED
        <td>Editor's Draft
    <tr>
        <td>WD
        <td>W3C Working Draft
    <tr>
        <td>CR
        <td>W3C Candidate Recommendation
    <tr>
        <td>PR
        <td>W3C Proposed Recommendation
    <tr>
        <td>REC
        <td>W3C Recommendation
    <tr>
        <td>PER
        <td>W3C Proposed Edited Recommendation
    <tr>
        <td>NOTE
        <td>W3C Working Group Note
</table>

<p>By default, the <span data-anolis-xref="normal string substitution">normal
string substitutions</span> are:

<dl>
    <dt><code>[<!---->DATE]</code>
    <dd>This is replaced with the current date for UTC±0 in the form of, e.g.,
<samp>31 July 2008</samp>. The word used for the month is dependent on the
current locale of Python. The number of the day of the month has no leading
zeros.
    
    <dt><code>[<!---->CDATE]</code>
    <dd>This is replaced with the current date for UTC±0 in the form YYYYMMDD,
e.g., <samp>20080731</samp>. This is a conforming <a
href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874">ISO
8601:2004</a> date.
    
    <dt><code>[<!---->YEAR]</code>
    <dd>This is replaced with the current year for UTC±0, in the form YYYY,
e.g., <samp>2008</samp>. This is a conforming <a
href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874">ISO
8601:2004</a> year.
    
    <dt><code>[<!---->TITLE]</code>
    <dd>This is replaced with the <span>textContent</span> of the first
<code>title</code> element which is within the first <code>head</code> of the
document, or an empty string if such a <code>title</code> element does not
exist.
</dl>

<p>There is one comment substitution by default. Any nodes between a comment
with a value equal to (with leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span>
removed) <code>begin-link</code> and one with a value equal to
<code>end-link</code>, with <span>interactive content</span> elements removed
(though children of those elements preserved), are effectively wrapped in an
<code>a</code> element which has a <code>href</code> attribute equal to the
<code>textContent</code> of all the nodes between the two comments concatenated
in document order. The two comments must have the same parent, otherwise a
<span>fatal error</span> occurs.

<p>If <dfn><code>--w3c-compat-substitutions</code></dfn> is enabled, the
following <span data-anolis-xref="normal string substitution">normal string
substitutions</span> are done in addition to those above:

<dl>
    <dt><code>[STATUS]</code>
    <dd>This is replaced with the <span>W3C status</span>.
    
    <dt><code>[LONGSTATUS]</code>
    <dd>This is replaced with the <span>long W3C status</span>.
</dl>

<p>Additionally, the following <span data-anolis-xref="normal comment
substitution">normal comment substitutions</span> are done:

<dl>
    <dt><var>sub_identifier</var> equal to <code>logo</code>
    <dd>Replacement is equal to: <code>&lt;p>&lt;a
href="http://www.w3.org/">&lt;img alt="W3C"
src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home"/>&lt;/a>&lt;/p></code> (parsed as an XML
fragment, and serialized into the output document in the needed format).
    
    <dt><var>sub_identifier</var> equal to <code>copyright</code> 
    <dd>Replacement is equal to: <code>&lt;p class="copyright">&lt;a

</dl>

<p>There is one further string substitution, and this is only done when
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-crazy-substitutions</code></dfn> is enabled (note that
this is not included in <code>--w3c-compat</code>). A string of
<code>http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-</code> followed by one or more
characters in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER Z (A–Z) is replaced with whatever
<code>http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-[STATUS]</code> would evaluate to
be. Like the <span data-anolis-xref="normal string substitution">normal string
substitutions</span>, this string must be contained in a single text node.

<!-- Is that crazy enough to justify the option name? -->

<p>Special thanks to Bert Bos for creating the CSS3 Module Postprocessor, on
which this is partially based, and (with <code>--w3c-compat</code>) claims to
be partially compatible with. Further special thanks to Bert Bos for creating a
number of things (especially the algorithm for finding the <span>W3C
status</span>) that took the author of Anolis many hours to reverse
engineer.
