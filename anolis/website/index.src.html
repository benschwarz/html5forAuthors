<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The need for Anolis came from the need for long technical documents to
include niceties such as cross-references and a table of contents for the
purpose of easy navigation â€” doing this manually can be a great chore
especially when sections are numbered and a section is added, consequently
changing the numbering of many others, leading to it being advantageous to do it
programmatically.</p>

<p>Anolis does this on HTML documents, as a number of sequential processes.
Currently cross-referencing, section numbering, table of contents creation, and
a number of substitutions are done (mainly relating to the current
date).</p>

<h2>Installing Anolis</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The following are the minimum requirements: later versions should also work
without issue.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> 2.3
	<li><a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a> 2.0
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib">html5lib</a> 0.10
</ul>

<h3>Obtaining a copy</h3>

<p>The latest release is 1.0. This can downloaded as a 
<a href="http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/archive/1.0.tar.bz2#egg=anolis-1.0">bzip2</a>,
<a href="http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/archive/1.0.zip#egg=anolis-1.0">zip</a>, or
<a href="http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/archive/1.0.tar.gz#egg=anolis-1.0">gzip</a>
archive.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a copy can be obtained from <dfn>our <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> repository</dfn>: this is
where our ongoing development occurs, and allows any revision (and therefore any
release) to be downloaded. Our repository is located at
<code><!--begin-link-->http://hg.gsnedders.com/anolis/<!--end-link--></code>.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Normally, installation is done through <a
href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>, with the following
command:</p>

<p><code>python setup.py install</code></p>

<p>Please see setuptools' documentation for information on installation options
(such as installing in non-standard locations).</p>

<h3>Running the test suite</h3>

<p>The source distribution and the current development copy (in <span title="our
mercurial repository">Mercurial</span>) both contain a test suite. It can be run
with the following command:</p>

<p><code>python runtests.py</code></p>

<p>Any test failures should be reported at our
<dfn><a href="http://bugs.gsnedders.com/projects/show/anolis">bug
tracker</a></dfn>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation is included with the latest release, and the documentation for
the latest release can be obtained <a

<p>Thanks to Andrew Sidwell, Anne van Kesteren, Henri Sivonen, Ian Hickson,
James Graham, Lachlan Hunt, Magnus Kristiansen, Michael(tm) Smith, and Philip

<p>Special thanks to Bert Bos for creating the CSS3 Module Postprocessor, on
which this is partially based, and (with <code>--w3c-compat</code>) claims to be
partially compatible with. Further special thanks to Bert Bos for creating a
number of things (especially the algorithm for finding the W3C status) that took
the author of Anolis many hours to reverse engineer.</p>
