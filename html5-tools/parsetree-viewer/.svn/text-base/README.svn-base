This directory contains a set of scripts/html files for viewing
html5lib parse trees in the browser. The main script, parsetree.py is
intended to be run as a CGI script. It is assumed it will live at a
relative URI /cgi-bin/parsetree/parsetree.py If this is not the case
the HTML files must be edited to point to the actual location of the
script.

Dependencies:

html5lib - http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/
